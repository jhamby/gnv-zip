This is a packaging of Zip 3.0 from the Info-ZIP project.

  http://www.info-zip.org

Note: This is a hobbyist effort and is not providing any support or any
commitment to supply bug fixes or future releases.  This code is as-is
with no warrantees.

Info-ZIP is already maintaining a VMS port, mainly for DCL mode.  The
Info-ZIP.org is not maintaining the packaging at this time.

While we will feed back any changes made here to Info-ZIP.org, we have no
control of what they will do with them.

And they of course are not responsible for fixing any issues that may have
been introduced in this packaging for GNV.

The testing of this port of Zip involved some spot testing of the
various utilities.

Special installation notes:

*  Please see https://sourceforge.net/p/gnv/wiki/InstallingGNVPackages/
   for the latest information on installing GNV related PCSI kits.

*  We are updating and replacing GNV one kit at a time and transitioning
   GNV to be a set of kits that the GNV package will install.  During
   this transition some extra issues will need to be handled during
   installs and upgrades.

*  This package should be installed to the same volume as GNV is installed.

   If you uninstall or upgrade GNV or install a GNV from before the
   transition is complete, you will need to reinstall all other packages
   that install to the same GNV directory tree.

   This is because at least some of the existing GNV installation procedures
   have bugs in them were instead of just deleting the files that were
   installed, they delete all files in the GNV directory tree.

*  Because this is a transition, this package is replacing files from the
   old GNV packages.  This is a necessary issue to allow incremental
   improvement as we can not replace the GNV package until we get all
   the component packages done.

*  The GNV 2.x through at least the 3.0.1 kits make an unusual change
   to the disk directory structure where they are installed where
   they use the [vms$common.gnv] as a mount point and mount the posix
   root on it.  This is a bug because it causes many problems and does
   not offer any advantages.  One of the problems is that it causes
   problems with other PCSI installs and uninstalls to that directory.

   This bug can be manually repaired such as has been done on
   on encompasserve.org as documented in PORTING_TO_VMS notes conference.

   At this time, we do not have a scripted repair to this bug, and it
   may not be possible to fully script a repair because this bug can
   cause the POSIX root and [vms$common.gnv] to have different contents
   when they should be the same directory, and it will take a manual
   inspection to select which files go where.

*  Because of the directory change bug, the gnv$startup.com in the GNV
   kit must be run when the system boots up or the [vms$common.gnv]
   directory will appear to be empty.

   If a PCSI kit like this one is installed when the GNV startup has not
   been run, it will create a new directory tree under [vms$common.gnv]
   that will not be visible to the posix root.  If you uninstall this
   PCSI kit before running the gnv$startup.com procedure then you can
   install it after running the gnv$startup.com procedure.  If you have
   run the gnv$startup.com procedure after the install, then you have
   a mess, and you will need to use the GNV umnt to un-mount the
   [vms$common.gnv] directory before the uninstall of this kit will
   work.

An analyze/disk/repair step on the installation disk should be done after
installation to collect files left over from incomplete deletions into the
SYSLOST directory.  This step should be done on a "quiet" system per HP
recomendations.

The Info-ZIP.org is maintaining a bug tracker for their code at
http://www.info-zip.org/zip-bug.html, but at this time are not maintaining
the GNV variant of zip or unzip.

Bugs can also be logged at the tracker with
https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnv/.
There is no guarantee that bugs will be fixed for a hobbyist build.

VMS specific port information:

The Info-ZIP VMS port uses "ZIP_OPTS" instead of "ZIP" for the environment
variable for options.

The Info-ZIP VMS port of zip and unzip have not been specifically set up
for GNV at this time, so there may be some incompatibilities with GNV
that may show up.

The logical name GNV$GNU is used to find the simulated posix root and defines
the logical name SYS$POSIX_ROOT in the process table in user mode for child
processes if needed.

This port of Zip uses the VMS CRTL to handle the Unix format pathnames
and as such is dependent on them.  It is a known issue that directories with
a Unix name "file.dir/" and some symbolic links are not handled correctly.
This is a combination of problems with RMS and CRTL.  The RMS portion is
fixed with the VMS84?_RMS-V0300 ECO kit.  I am not aware of a CRTL kit that
fixes the issues.

This kit is designed to be used with the GNV Bash 4.2.45 or later kit or with
DCL.

Fixes and enhancements in the GNV Zip 3.0.0 kit.

* The names of the zip images have been prefixed with GNV$ to prevent
  possible naming conflicts with other programs that are on the system.  The
  GNV$ prefix has been registered with HP for this purpose.

* A zip_verb.cld file has been provided for installing the gnv$zip_cli.exe
  image from gnv$gnu:[vms_bin] as a DCL command.  Currently the help
  for the zip cli command only shows the traditional foreign command setup.

  $ set command gnv$gnu:[vms_bin]zip_verb
  $ show sym zip
  %DCL-W-UNDSYM, undefined symbol - check validity and spelling
  $ zip /help

  Zip 3.0 (July 5th 2008). Usage: (zip :== $ dev:[dir]zip_cli.exe)

* This image is statically linked with the libbz2*.olb so that the bzip2
  package does not need to be installed.


OpenVMS specific building and kitting instructions are after the standard
bash readme file below.

The source kits contains files for building Zip using DCL.

port.

There may have also been other bugs in the GNV packaging of zip for OpenVMS
that were not officially recorded but have now been fixed as a result of
resolving the above listed bug reports. So, you are encouraged to try out
this release and report anomolies on the GNV Bug Reporting page:

https://sourceforge.net/p/gnv/bugs/?source=navbar

Currently, the focus of the OpenVMS GNV porting team is to address bugs in
the OpenVMS port of GNV components that pose immediate barriers to running
configure and make scripts for Open Source Software packages targeting
OpenVMS environments.

The GNV development team is involved in an ongoing effort to identify and
document the underlying technical causes for these current limitations and (if
available) workarounds as well as developing code fixes to eliminate them. The
VMS-Ports Source Forge project at https://sourceforge.net/p/vms-ports/tickets/
currently documents OpenVMS CRTL bugs and limitations with respect to porting
Open Source Software using OpenVMS. The VMS-Ports Source Forge Project also
contains examples of ported packages provided by volunteer contributors as well
as documentation with recommendations on how to setup, modify and use the
OpenVMS GNV environment for the purpose of porting Open Source software
packages to OpenVMS. Browse to https://sourceforge.net/p/vms-ports/wiki/Home/
